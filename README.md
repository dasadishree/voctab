**Voctab - My Browser Extension!!**

Voctab enhances learning by turning each new browser tab into a quick study session with flashcards. Every time you open a tab, you will be able to study a vocab word along with its part of speech and definition, and options to import my SAT vocab list and shuffle. This extension is perfect for students studying for school tests, SAT, ACT, or new language learns, or anyone looking to expand their vocabulary with minimal effort!
